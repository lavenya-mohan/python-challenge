# python-challenge
This assignment will apply the concepts learned to complete two Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. These tasks simulate real-world scenarios where Python scripting skills will be put to practical use.

## _PyBank_
The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the financial records of a company. A financial dataset called  $${\color{lightblue}budget\\_data.csv}$$ will be provided, consisting of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The goal is to generate insights from this data using Python.
- [x] The total number of months included in the dataset
- [x] The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- [x] The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- [x] The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- [x] The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### Expected Output:

## _PyPoll_
The task is to create a Python script that helps to analyze a small, rural town to modernize its vote-counting process. A set of poll data called  $${\color{lightblue}election\\_data.csv}$$ will be provided, composed of three columns: Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The goal is to generate insights from this data using Python.
- [x] The total number of votes cast
- [x] A complete list of candidates who received votes
- [x] The percentage of votes each candidate won
- [x] The total number of votes each candidate won
- [x] The winner of the election based on popular vote
