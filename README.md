# python-challenge
This assignment will apply the concepts learned to complete two Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. These tasks simulate real-world scenarios where Python scripting skills will be put to practical use.

## _PyBank_
The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the financial records of a company. A financial dataset called  $${\color{lightblue}budget_data.csv}$$ will be provided, consisting of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The goal is to generate insights from this data using Python.
+ The total number of months included in the dataset
+ The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
+ The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
+ The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
+ The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### Expected Output:
